## Description

Code repo for Refining Fast Calorimeter Simulations with a Schroedinger Bridge.

The Schroedinger Bridge implementations are based on https://github.com/JTT94/diffusion_schrodinger_bridge and the corresponding paper:

              title={Diffusion Schr$\backslash$" odinger Bridge with Applications to Score-Based Generative Modeling},
              author={De Bortoli, Valentin and Thornton, James and Heng, Jeremy and Doucet, Arnaud},
              journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.01357},
              year={2021}
            }
```

## Running the Setup

The required packages are listed in the `environment.yml` file. Data for running the model can be found under 10.5281/zenodo.8275193, and should be placed in the `data` folder.
